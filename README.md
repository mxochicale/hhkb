Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB)
---

Today, Monday the 5th of March 2018, I have collected my HHKB which comes from JAPAN.
I have been waiting for this experience for a year and it makes me feel so smoothly
(re-reading on 23 march 2018 -- I didn't know what I mean by smoothly I guess I felt
nice and cool about using such nice gizmo).
However, before to start fully enjoying such fabulous experience. 
I want to put some thoughts about the use of the keyboard.

Well, when connecting your HHKB for the first time, it is suggested that you keep 
your old keyboard connected, in case you need to type something that you are not 
familiar with the new keyboard, in my case the keyboard shortcuts are taking me a 
while to get used to them, specially for a blank keypad and with this keyboard 
layout of using FN+keys to use the arrows.



## General Instructions of usage


1. Connect Bluetooth dongle
2. Go to bluetooth settings menu and set a new devices by clicking PLUS 
3. When connecting for the first time, push to the on/off button varios
times until appears in the near range devices 
4. then select HHKB-BT and type
the displayed numbers and hit enter in order to pair the keyboard.
(write down some number in a blank sheet and put it under the keyboard
to type the numbers).
5. Pair keyboard trough bluetooth by typing some numbers 
6.. Select Switches:   
* SW3ON:DEL   
* SW5ON:o-alt-space-alt-o

# thoughts > keyboard

This is sort of an interested primitive behaviour of putting our raw thoughts 
as quickly and efficiently as you can. So, to do this, one basically avoid looking and 
the keyboard. It is like those professional pianist who after many years of practice
there is point on their life that they do play the piano too naturally and unconsciously 
that there not really effort on how to put what is one's mind into words.
Honestly, I am not closer to that professionalism, specially I am struggling  with 
the functions arrow keys and the control arrows with the function key 
(a bit annoying but I am getting there) 

Now that I am editing this raw thoughts, this action of typing it, it is 
sort of primitive and repetitive process of hitting keys with your fingers,
quite boring really.

I kind of have that experience of the people who created the first forms of 
writing expressions on stones 2000 years ago (5march2018).

> Imagine in the future that with everykey that you hit you can produce some nice 
arrange of words that can help to create better world (e.g. paragraph, book, article, etc.)

* this new primitive task of mine "hitting keys in a blank 
keypad HHKB keyboard @PFU_HHKB". It feels nice, I specially like 
this exercise of avoiding looking at the keyboard to the point 
I would put all my raw thoughts into a machine with a 
delay of milliseconds (not measured yet)
