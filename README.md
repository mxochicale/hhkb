Happy Hacking Keyboard 
---

Today, Monday, the 5th of March 2018, I have collected my hhkb which comes from JAPAN,
it makes me too happy to type in this blankkeyboard, but before you start enjoyig such
fabulous experiences. I want to put some thoughts about the use of the keyboard.


When connecting your hhkb for the first time, it is suggested that you keep 
your old keyboard connected, in case you need to type something that you are
very familiar with, in my case the keyboard shortcuts which take a bit of time
to get used to them, specially for a blank keypad.

## General Instructions of usage
1. Pair keyboard trought bluetooth by typing some 
2. Select Switches:

SW3ON:DEL
SW5ON:o-alt-space-alt-o

# thoughts > keyboard

This is sort an insterested exercises of putting your thgouths as purrely 
and efficiently as you can. So, to do this, you basically avoid looking and 
your keyboard, I imagine is that those professional pianist of many years of practice
there is point on their life that they do it too naturally as cycling a bike.
I am not closer to that as doing the keyboard shortcuts usually take some time 
for me but I guess trought practice I will no longer need to look the keyboard.
Now that I am typing this might be a pure mechanical and boring process of typing
your thoughts into the keyboard, like it was 2000 years ago when people 
create the first forms of writing experssions on stones.
