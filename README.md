This is sort an insterested exercises of putting your thgouths as purrely 
and efficiently as you can. So, to do this, you basically avoid looking and 
your keyboard, I imagine is that those professional pianist of many years of practice
there is point on their life that they do it too naturally as cycling a bike.
I am not closer to that as doing the keyboard shortcuts usually take some time 
for me but I guess trought practice I will no longer need to look the keyboard.
Now that I am typing this might be a pure mechanical and boring process of typing
your thoughts into the keyboard, like it was 2000 years ago when people 
create the first forms of writing experssions on stones.
